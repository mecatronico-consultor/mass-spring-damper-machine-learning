# mass-spring-damper-machine-learning
This project uses a trained Machine Learning (ML) model in MATLAB to predict the equilibrium point of a mass-spring-damper mechanical system. The model predicts the equilibrium position ( x _eq ) from the system's properties ( m , c , k ) and the applied force ( F ). The code includes a comparison with the analytical calculation.
